Hey, I'm Travis - a sustainability consultant, building engineer & project manager.

This is where I share some of my work and the things that interest me.

I work as a freelance consultant helping individuals, organisations, governments and not-for-profits make their buildings better for people and our planet.

Learn more about me or see what I'm up to now.
