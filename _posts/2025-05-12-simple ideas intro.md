A blog sharing my simple ideas on how to make our buildings better.
Buildings where we spend ever increasing amounts of our time. 

My focus will be exploring opportunities in Lusaka, Zambia - the city that I live and work.

A place where I see so much potential to improve the way we design, build, renovate, maintain and operate our buildings - our homes, workplaces, hospitals, schools etc.

My goal is to provide resources and ideas that help the Zambian industry deliver better buildings, known commonly as Green Buildings. My yardstick is providing the information that that help design Green Buildings in Zambia that I can't find online. 

**To help make our buildings a little better - healthier, resilient and greener.**

WORKING 
Lusaka and more broadly Zambia.

My ideas draw upon experience working in the building industry over the past 20 years and deep desire to help Zambia develop cities and buildings that are healthier, more resilient to climate impacts (flooding, power outages, water shortages) and lessen their impact on our environment.

Better buildings that are "green".

A city who's population has doubled to 3.5 million in the past 15 years [https://worldpopulationreview.com/cities/zambia/lusaka#:~:text=Lusaka%20has%20grown%20by%20146,650%20in%20the%20last,latest%20revision%20of%20the%20UN%20World%20Urbanization%20Prospects.]. A city vulnerable to climate impacts, Currently, ongoing power outages, as a consequence drought impacting hydropower generation. Climate vulnerabilities in Lusaka will continue 

The place where I live and work. 
 Making them better for us and the planet.
Better buildings 

I don't pretend to be a writer, and don't necessarily have an audience in mind.


* Green Building design using climatic data - typically test reference year
* Quality data hard to come for many developing countries due to lack of 
* Rubbish in is equal to rubbish out
* "Computer simulation is never accurate, but some models are useful" quote
* Great source of data is ....
* Alternately one can download historical weather data for many locations

* Next post will explore power of [Climate Consultant][climate-cons] to help explore passive design opportunities relevant to Lusaka.
