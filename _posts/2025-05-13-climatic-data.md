For buildings to be a little greener, they must better respond to their environment and climate . Generally, a building is not "green" if it has been designed and built with no or little regard for the heat from the sun, the temperature and humidity of the air, or the speed and direction of the wind throughout the year.

These climate variables are all too often ignored, or seem as design constraints, overcome with technology - larger sized air conditioning, more solar panels. Not climate adapted building design where these same variables may present opportunities to design better buildings - effective natural ventilation and external sun shading. 

A common starting point for designing climate-adapted, sustainable, green buildings is to complete an anaylsis to better understand the climate. 

I find that the free and open source web based tool [CBE Clima Tool][clima-tool] developed by University of Berkeley Center for the Build Environment is a great starting point.

The tool allow users to analyse climate data for over 20 locations across Zambia or 27,000 locations across the world. 

Some Zambian specific locations include:
* Lusaka - International Airport 

The data known as a Typical Meteorological Year (TMY), in which weather data is condensed into a year of the most usual conditions. This is the common weather file type used for building energy modelling - EnergyPlus or IES VE.

Alternately, a Actual Meteorological Year (AMY), consisting of actual hourly data sets over a a year time period, put into the same format as a TMY file maybe used. In a future post I will talk an excellent resource for generating these files for any location in the world.

The format of the weather file used as a basis for the analysis is a EPW file. This is a common file input file used for building energy modelling software - Energy Plus or IES Virtual Environment.




Some of outputs that I find useful from the tool include:



The best place to start to understand the tool and its input data is here: https://cbe-berkeley.gitbook.io/clima

However, using the tool is only half the equation - 
Limitations of the tool

Included below are some of fantastic graphical outputs that maybe generated from the tool.


This is not how buildings have historically been built either.

A great place to climate data to inform building 




* Green Building design using climatic data - typically test reference year
* Quality data hard to come for many developing countries due to lack of 
* Rubbish in is equal to rubbish out
* "Computer simulation is never accurate, but some models are useful" quote
* Great source of data is ....
* Alternately one can download historical weather data for many locations

* Next post will explore power of [Climate Consultant][climate-cons] to help explore passive design opportunities relevant to Lusaka.
